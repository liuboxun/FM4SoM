"""
PatchGAN Discriminator (https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/blob/master/models/networks.py#L538)


This isn't a standward GAN discriminator, where the input is a batch of images and the output is a batch of real/fake labels.


But instead, PatchGAN discriminator is a network that takes a batch of images
split into multiple patches 

for ex. - 30-30 patches, 30 in x and 30 in y axis, similar to convolution kernels, 
and then runs them through a network to get a score of real/fake on those individual patches. 

ex. - input size (1, 3, 256, 256) -> output size (1, 1, 30, 30)
